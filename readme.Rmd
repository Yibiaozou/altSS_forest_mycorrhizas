## Alternative Stable states of the Forest Mycobiome
This R project contains all code to replicate analyses and figures presented in Averill et al. 202x. Alternative Stable States of the Forest Mycobiome.

The file `paths.r` is sourced at the top of all analysis and figures scripts. This file tracks all file paths within the project. To run this code, the user needs to change the path object `storage.dir` within the paths.r file to match the location of the data directory on their computer. Furthermore, you will need a copy of the US Forest Inventory and Analysis Database, version 7. This project uses a pSQL version of this database. The path to this directory of files needs to be specified in `paths.r`. I have kept the FIA7 directory out of the overall storage directory, as the FIA database is huge.

This project also depends on several custom functions housed in `project_functions` as well as a few small reference data files, housed in `required_products_utilities`. Finally, this analysis depends on the CASTNET nitrogen deposition product, and the worldclim2 climate product. Paths to the rasters from these products need to be specified when using the functions `worldclim2_grab()` and `extract_ndep()`.

The directory `1._data_construction` contains all code to work up data within the FIA7 database into analysis ready products. These scripts are numbered and must be run in order.

The directory `2._data_analysis` contains all code to replicate analyses and simulations described in the paper. The hystersis simulation is computationally intensive, and takes several hours to run on a 28-core computing cluster.

These analyses depend on a number of custom functions, found within the functions/ directory.

All analysis output is stored in the data directory specified in the paths.r script. All figures are stored within the project repository sub directory figures/. This subdirectory is ignored for the purposes of git tracking.

This project was built under R version 3.6.1 and depends on the following packages:
`betareg`
`boot`
`data.table`
`doParallel`
`ggalt`
`ggplot2`
`ggpubr`
`raster`
`magick`
`purrr`
`mgcv`
